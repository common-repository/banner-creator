Lets you design your custom banners either with image, code or visual editor. Also keeps track of each clicks/views and much more.

== Description ==

Banner Ads Creator will help you create custom banners for your website. There are 25+ predefined most used banner sizes which are tested by publishers to get most impressions.

This plugin is an alternative to any third party advertisers when you want to make your own ads to show on your site. You can design your ads as you want and show them inside post automatically or manually with shortcodes.

This plugin will generate 3 type of codes for each banner you make:
1. Shortcode (sync/async)
2. HTML code (sync/async)
3. iFrame code

All of those code types make it possible to place them anywhere you like. Any widgetized areas can have HTML code or iframe code. You can also use shortcode to show it in any post/pages or custom post types.

You can display ads automatically on any of the 3 available area inside post:
1. Starting of a post
2. Middle of a post (Placed in middle of total number of paragraph)
3. Ending of a post

However, if you make multiple banners and set them all to show in the same position, only one of them will be shown randomly each time. If you want to display multiple, you can make use of shortcodes.

Another nice thing about this plugin is, it will keep track of each click or views of the banners you show. You can export/import this data in case you need to backup or transfer your statistics.
